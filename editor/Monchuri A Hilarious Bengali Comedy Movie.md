Monchuri is a movie that has tried to make a comedy out of crime and corruption. The movie shows how a college teaches its students the skills of theft and robbery, and how they use them to achieve their goals. The movie also mocks the political system and the media, and shows how they are manipulated by the criminals. The movie tries to create a satire on the society and its problems, but fails to deliver a coherent message or a satisfying conclusion.
 
Monchuri is a movie that has some moments of laughter, but mostly disappoints with its poor execution and presentation. It is a movie that could have been much better with a better script, direction and production. It is a movie that might appeal to some fans of Bengali comedy, but not to others who expect more from a movie.

Monchuri has a star cast of talented actors who have done justice to their roles. Saswata Chatterjee and Biswanath Bose play the lead roles of Kartik and Ganesh, who are the best students of the college for criminals. They have a good chemistry and comic timing, and make the audience laugh with their antics. Kharaj Mukherjee plays the role of Dharmadas, the principal of the college, who is also a master thief and a guru to his students. He has a hilarious character and delivers some of the best dialogues in the movie. Koneenica Banerjee and Damini Basu play the roles of the dominating wives of Kartik and Ganesh, who make their lives miserable. They have done a decent job in their roles, but their characters are not very well developed.
 
Monchuri has a music score by Raja Narayan Deb, who has composed some catchy songs for the movie. The songs are mostly upbeat and fun, and suit the mood of the movie. The songs are sung by various singers like Rupankar Bagchi, Anwesha Datta Gupta, Somlata Acharyya Chowdhury and others. The songs are well choreographed and picturized, and add some entertainment value to the movie.
